# Bike-Sales-Analysis
Global bike sales and customer data


## Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insight into the kinds of customers who are purchasing bikes. By analyzing the customer data, we seek to identify trends and make data-driven recommendations to help identify which customers to market to the most.

I chose to focus on North America but have created a dashboard that explores data in other regions.

We will be able to answer key questions, such as:

- Do single people buy more bikes than married people in North America?
- Which gender is purchasing more bikes in North America?
- What age bracket is mostly buying bikes in North America?
